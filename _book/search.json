    "text": "3.1.1 Simple ANOVA\nIt is an ANOVA with only one factor with non repeated measures.\nThe main idea of ANOVA is that we compare the means across groups taking into account the variability (the variance) within each group.\nThe historical interpretation is that we decompose the variance into variance between groups and variance within groups:\n\\[SS_{tot} = SS_{g} + SS_{resid}\\], where \\(SS_{tot}\\) represents the total sum of squared residuals (\\(y_{ij}-m_{glob}\\) with \\(m_{glob}\\) equal to the global mean), \\(SS_g\\) is equal to the sum of squared residuals between groups (\\(m_g - m_{glob}\\)), and \\(SS_{resid}\\) is equal to the sum of squared residuals within groups (\\(y_{ig}-m_g\\)). Then, the F statistic is equal to \\(F = \\frac{SS_g/(G-1)}{SS_{resid}/(N-G)}\\). The statistic \\(F = \\frac{n * S^2_{m_g}}{\\sum_gS^2_g/G}\\), where \\(S^2_{m_g}\\) represents the estimated variance of the group means (\\(m_g\\)), and \\(\\sum_gS^2_g/G\\) represents the estimated intra-group variance, \\(G\\) the total number of groups.",
